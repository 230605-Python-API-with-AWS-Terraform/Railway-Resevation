# Railway-Resevation :
Reservations can be made through the
Indian railways site or at the ample reservation centers all over the country.
Also now there are authorized agencies which provide reservation facility
on behalf of India railways and without waiting in long line one can easily
book a ticket. The booking is done through an E- Ticket issue which has a
PNR number of which one has to take a print and just have to show at the
station.
This is a project based on train reservation. The program helps us to enter,
display or alter the details of different trains.
Moreover & most importantly the program helps us to reserve or cancel a
train ticket.
The program also helps us to know the present status of a reserved ticket,
i.e. whether the ticket is confirmed or not.
